# Linux on the CH32V003
This project is shamelessly copied with permission from 
https://github.com/tvlad1234/linux-ch32v003

I wanted to play with this project and work on my skills so I created my 
own version of the board. I mean, comeon, linux on a $0.15 microcontroller.
This is V1, currently on order from JLCPCB. I will update once it is tested
